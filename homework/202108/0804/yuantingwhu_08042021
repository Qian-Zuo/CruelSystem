9.1 Atomicity 
Atomicity is a property required in several different areas of computer system design. 


9.1.1 All-or-Nothing Atomicity in a Database 
Example: consider a database of bank accounts. Define a procedure named TRANSFER that debits one account and credits a second account,
both of which are stored on disk. This should be done as an all-or-nothing atomic action.

9.1.2 All-or-Nothing Atomicity in the Interrupt Interface 
Example: in the processor instruction set interface as seen by a thread. 
Thread: a thread normally performs actions one after another, as directed by the instructions of the current program, but that certain
events may catch the attention of the threadâ€™s interpreter, causing the interpreter, rather than the program, to supply the next
instruction.
