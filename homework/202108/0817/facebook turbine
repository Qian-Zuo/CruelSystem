situation:
Turbine is trying fix the gap between current general purpose cluster management frameworks and the stream processing requirement.
Turbine is a fast and scalable task scheduler, predictive autoscaler, 

challenge:
manage in loosely coupled microservices 
where to run (task management)
how to run (resource management)
maintaining the strict SLOs

action:
1 two level placement: place shard into container, then place stream processing task onto each shards. dynamically load balance
2 autoscale: estimate the resource needed, calculate estimated resource per task, iteratively adjust based on historical data
3 application update mechanism: ensure updates sending from multiple actors (provisioner service, autoscaler, human operator) are  isolated and consistent and performed correctly. Utilized a hierarchical job configuration structure and merges updates.
