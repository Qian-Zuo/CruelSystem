9.1.4 Some Actions With and Without the All-or-Nothing Property 
Actions that lack the all-or-nothing property have frequently been discovered upon adding multilevel memory management to a computer architecture, 
especially to a processor that is highly pipelined. 

9.1.5 Before-or-After Atomicity: Coordinating Concurrent Threads 
the goal of concurrency being to improve performance by running several things at the same time. 
two coordination requirements: sequence coordination and before-or-after atomicity. Sequence coordination is a constraint of the type “Action W must 
happen before action X”.  before-or-after atomicity is a more general constraint that several actions that concurrently operate on the same data should not interfere with one another. 

Before-or-after atomicity 
Concurrent actions have the before-or-after property if their effect from the point of view of their invokers is the same as if the actions occurred 
either completely before or completely after one another. 

9.1.6 Correctness and Serialization 
coordination among concurrent actions can be 
considered to be correct if every result is guaranteed to be one that could have been obtained 
by some purely serial application of those same actions.
