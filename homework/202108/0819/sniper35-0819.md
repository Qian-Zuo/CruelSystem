Design Tiktok

functional requirement:
upload video: client agnostic
user interaction: like/favorite comment video, follow/unfollow users
video feed: only display videos from users followed or top trending videos or mix mode

some estimations:
video length: max 1min, video can contain text and other data, 5MB * 2 vidoe/ user.day
1M daily active user

non-functional requirement:

availabilty: should be higly available, 3 9's, 
latency: needs low latency to keep up mobile user experience
scalable: should be highly scalable


Upload videos:
API(userid, video url): video should be stored at blob storage, we need RDB to store the user<->video link table, 
RDB vs Non Relational DB: structural, lots of table join?  search by keys? 

View feed: 
pre-load videos  to reduce the waiting time, cache top 10 videos for uses. pre-cache service could be internal service and 
the service will read another read-only video table to reduce the read throughput of the vidoe db. This pre-load strategy is
avoid the huge users' concurrent read on the video db


user activity:
API(userid, video) will have another db to store the like count 


bottlneck:
use cdn to handle user request based on geo-location, the user will hit the nearest cdn. 
use load balancer: one service has multiple endpoint and load balancer decides which endpoint to handle to distribute the
traffic to different avilalbe endpoints
db sharding: may shard db according to different regions and load balancer handle requests to the nearby sharded db instead
of the single master db.
