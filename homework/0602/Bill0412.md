# D024 Raft(Extended) (2/6)
## 5. The Raft concensus algorithm

1. Leader election
2. Log replication: the leader accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster
3. Saftey: State Machine Safety Property

Raft guarantees all the following properties
- Election Safety: only one leader at a time
- Leader Append-Only: a leader never overwrites or deletes entries in its log
- Log Matching: a pair of index and term uniquely identifies a log record
- Leader Completeness
- State Machine Safety

### 5.1 Raft basics
5 is the typical number of servers in a raft cluster, with 3 of them for follower, candidate, 1 for candidate, 1 for leader.

Time is divided into terms, and each term begins with an election, and with a single elected leader. Terms act as a logical clock in Raft, and they allow servers to detect obsolete information such as stale leaders.

### 5.2 Leader election

Raft uses a hearbeat mechanism to trigger leader election. A server starts as a follower, and it remains follower as long as it receives heatbeat(valid RPCs) from a leader a candidate. 

A follower increments its current term and transitions to candidate state to begin a election. A candidate continues in this state until
- it wins the election
- another server establishes itself as leader
- a period of time goes by with no winner

When a candiidate wins an election, it broadcasts heatbeat messages to establish its authority.

Raft uses randomized election timeouts to ensure that split votes are rare and they are resolved quickly.
