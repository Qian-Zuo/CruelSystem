# Lecture 4: Primary-Backup Replication(2/2)
## Divergence sources
non-deterministic
- input packets
- timer interrupts

Some of the results can be undeterministic, for example, the time interrupts. A timer interrupt may happen at a time for the primary while a different time for the backup. 

## Handle non-determinism
The FT hypervisor reads the whole instruction list and finds the non-deterministic instructions and reads and caches the result for them.

## Output rule
The primary only outputs a result when it receives the acknowledgement from backup.

## Summary
This lecture is about the primary-backup mechanism. There might be 2 ways to synchronize a backup virtual machine, one is to send states, another is to send inputs as state machine. To save the bandwidth, the latter is prefered. Then the professor talks about the major challenges of it, for example, how to make all the non-deterministic operations deterministic. For non-deterministic operations like input packets and timer interrupts, a good way is to cache the intterupt and send the identical interrupt to the backup machine after same number of instructions as the primary one. The performance of the whole system is fairly good with almost no performance degradation and takes about 30% of bandwidth of the two inter-conneted virtual machines.
