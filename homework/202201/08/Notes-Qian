How to partition?
1. Fixed number of partitions: this is to grab a partition from the previous nodes and assign to the new node.
2. Dynamicc partitioning: When a partition grows to exceed a configured size, it is split into two partitions so that approximately half
of the data ends up on each side of the split. This approach can make good use of the space.
It needs human to manually rebalancing the cluster.
3.After rebalancing, several ways can be used to deal with requests: 1. load balancer; 2. client talks with the a routing tier first and go to the
right node; 3. the client is aware of the correct node and visits it directly.
