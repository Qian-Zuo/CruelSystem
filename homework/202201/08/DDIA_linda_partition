	rebalancing:
		1. fixed number of partitions -> # partitions >> # nodes 
			usually fixed when the database is first set up and not changed afterward

		2. Dynamic partitioning
			one partition one node. one node multiple partitions
			number of partitions adapts to the total data volume
			start with a single partition -> initial set of partitions to be configured. 

			1. partitions proportional to dataset size
			2. size of partition -> dataset size
			3. number of partitions -> number of nodes : fixed number of partitions per node
