1. Ambiguity requires a tolerance system.
  ACID: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
      - Consistency: the data must always be true and it depends on the application's notion of invariants. It is a property of application.
      - Isolation: It is a property of database.
      - Atomicity: It is a property of database.
      - Durability: It is a property of database.
