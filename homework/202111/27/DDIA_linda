Reliability
The system should continue to work correctly under faults.

fault-tolerant(resilient more realistic):

	fault: one component of the system deviating from its spec
	failure: system stops providing the required service to the user
    
    prevent faults from failures
	deliberately inducing faults to test
	prefer tolerating faults over preventing faults:

		Hardware Faults:
			mean time to failuer (MTTF) = 10-50 years (10,000 disks, one disk dies per day)

			add redundancy to hardware components: RAID, dual power supplies, hot-swappable CPUs
					  multi-machine redundancy only required when high availability is essential
					  As number of machines go up, machine instances may be come unavailable
					  system tolerate loss of entire machines by software fault-tolerance techniques. 

		Software Errors:

			no quick solution



Scalability
Should have reasonable ways of dealing with that growth in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity

Maintainability
People should all be able to work on it productively.
