Scalability
cope with increased load

    Load: load parameters (based on system)
    
    Performance: 
    	throughput : number of records we can process per second
    	response time:  the time between a client sending a request and receiving a response
    			(percentile used in service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs))


    scaling up (vertical scaling, moving to a more powerful machine) 
    scaling out (horizontal scaling, distributing the load across multiple smaller machines). 
    elastic: automatically add computing resoures



Maintainability
People should all be able to work on it productively. (Operability, Simplicity, Evolvability)
