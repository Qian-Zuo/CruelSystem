## Continue 
- systematic error, discrepancy 差异, decouple 解耦, sanbox，corner case, telemetry 遥测
- degradation 服务降级，
- Publish feeds, 4.6k/s, peek 12k/s, read 300k/s QPS, FanOut 扇出
- 1st solution: select * from tweets;
- 2nd solution: cache queue for each active user
- 3rd solution: hybrid
- throughput 吞吐量, response time = latency, service time, tail latencies 尾部延迟
- SLO/SLA, service level objectives/aggrements, 服务级别目标/协议
- queueing delay, head-of-line blocking
- Vertical scaling, scaling up
- Horizontal scaling, scaling out, shared-nothing, elastic, highly unpredicatable, stateless services
- Lagacy 遗留系统, a big ball of mud 烂泥潭, accidental complexity 额外的复杂度
- TDD, test driven development, refactoring 重构
