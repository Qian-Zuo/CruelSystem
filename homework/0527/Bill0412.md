# 0527 6.824 Lab 1: MapReduce Summary

## Our Job
In this lab we're going to implement a MapReduce system, with one coordinator process and one or more worker processes executing in parallel. The workers will talk to the coordinate via RPC(Remote Procedure Call) and the coordinator should notice if a worker does not finish the task before the deadline.

## A few rules
The worker should put intermediate Map output in files in the current directory, for later reduce tasks.
