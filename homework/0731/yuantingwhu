Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store
https://arthurchiao.art/blog/amazon-dynamo-zh/

Dynamo: highly available key-value store, currently named DynamoDB
Dynamo VS Redis
Targeted to be always writable VS for easily lost data
disk VS memory
distributed storage system VS single work station
performance

Background:
challenges for a massive e-commerce system: reliability at massive scale
Dynamo: a decentralized system

2.1 System requirements assumptions: 
Assumptions:
query model
use the only key to read and write.
any operation will not need multiple data items
for relative small file (less than 1MB)

   ACIDï¼ˆAtomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
permit only single key updates

   Efficiency

2.2 SLA (service Level Agreement)
2.3 Design 
eventually consistent data store
always writable, last write wins
incremental scalability
symmetry
decentralization
heterogeneity

3. 
3.1 Peer to Peer systems
3.2 distributed file system and database
typical distributed file systems supports hierarchical namespace##
