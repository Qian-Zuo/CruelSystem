Lecture 3 introduces GFS. First the lecturer analysis the reason the problems that nowadays industrial distributed systems have. For example, to reduce the latency, the distributed systems need high-performance shared data across different servers. And this many servers may cause constant faults. Then the system needs to handle fault tolerance. To handle this problem, replications are needed. And it leads to a further problem which is potential inconstant. To maintain strong consistency, we need to lower to the performance. This is contradictory. With this background knowledge, the lecturer starts to introduce the GFS, the main content of this lecture. He introduces the GFS with a lot of detailed info. From structures as to how the chunks spread in the system, how the reads and writes happen, to how the cache works in the system, etc. After watching this, the first thing that comes to my mind is how hard to design a good perfect distributed system. The answer is no perfect solutions. We always have to make trade-offs. Build the system to match the needs. And this made the system design a hard question for me as a junior. Because there are no standard answers to this kind of question. Discussion is always needed, no matter in the interview process, or in our real work.
