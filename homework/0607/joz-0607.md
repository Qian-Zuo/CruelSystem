## Pattern
All distriburted systems have single points of failure

mapreduce: coordinator
gdfs: master
vm: storage server 

the reason use single machine rather than the multiple machine is to **avoid the split brain**


## Case
suppose there are two replica servers, and client 1 will contact server 1 and server 2,

it cannot be determined whether server2 is failed or due to the network partition that s2 cannot response.

## Solution - Majority Rule

instead of two server, we use three. 

when a leader accepts an operation in a log of majority of the followers, it means the subsequece leader thats going to 
come out in the next term will also try to acquire a majority to get voted.

this is called **overlapping majority**

## Protocol Using Quorums

- paxos
- view stamped replication

Raft come out at 2014


## Raft Election

in Raft, there will always be one and only one leader

there will be an election timeout,
once a follower missing heartbeat from leader, the follower will then start an election

the follower will first increase the current term number, vote for himself and contact other followers to vote for him

follower will reject new logs which has smaller term number
