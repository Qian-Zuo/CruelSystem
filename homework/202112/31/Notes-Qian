1. Handling write conflicts Scenarios
- Multi-leader replication causes write conflicts if different leaders want to write different content  
  which would cause the content is not seen as the previous content so the transactions can't be successful.
- Synchronous VS asynchronous conflict
  Single leader wouldn't have any problem because only the leader can write.
  But the multi-leaders can cause problems: all of them can be succussful but the conflict can only detected asynchronously.
2. How to avoid? 
  - Single leader: no need to fix because all data goes to the same datacenter.
  - Multi-leader: Distribute users to a specific datacenter. But if a user's datacenter crashes, the user will be assigned to another datacenter.
    In this situation, the conflicts may happen again, then some check are needed.
  - Custom conflict resolution logic: most multi-dealer replication tools let you write conflict resolution logic using application code. 

3. In order to keep data safe in multi-leader mode, the leaders can copy their data to each other.
