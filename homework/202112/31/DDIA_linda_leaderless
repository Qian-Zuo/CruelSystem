		issue: write conflicts 
			multi-leader:  conflict is only detected asynchronously later. 
			want synchronous conflict detetion -: use single-leader replication

		solution: all writes for a particular record go through the same leader
				might go down if leader had to change;
				resolve the conflict in a convergent way 
				on write: 
				on read

		replication topologies: circular: id to prevent infinite replication loops
								start: 
								all-to-all: fault tolerance is better; 
											causality problem;


	Leaderless Replication:

		1. client sends writed to several replicas
		2. coordinator node does this onbehalf of the client -> no ordering of writes

		when a node is down: no failover; read requests are also sent to several nodes in parallel.
										version number to detect the latest 
							after back online: reparir when read; background process constantly copies any missing data from one replica to another.
							Quorums reads and writes: n nodes, w + r > n
