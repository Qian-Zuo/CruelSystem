		SSTables and LSM-Trees (Log-Structured Merge-Tree):

			Sorted by key (Sorted String Table SST)
			in-memory index to tell the offsets for some of the keys. (sparse)
			group records into block and compress it before writing to disk
			Each entry of the sparse in-memory index then points at the start of a compressed block.
			tree-insert keys in any order and read them back in sorted order.

		bloom filter : key does not appear

		size-tiered/ leveled compaction : order and timing of how SSTables are compacted and merged
		


page-oriented storage engines: (B- trees)
