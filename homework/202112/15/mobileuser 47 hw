Transaction processing vs analytic processing


Property	OLTP（transaction processing system）	OLAP（analytic system）
Main read pattern	Small number of records per query，by key	Aggregate over large number of records
Main write pattern	Random access, low latency	Bulk or stream
Use case	End uer/ web application	Internal analyst, decission support
What data represent 	Latest state of data	History of evetns
Data sie 	GB to TB	TB to PB


Data model
	- Start schema
		○ Fact table
		○ Dimension tables
	- Snowflake schema


Column-oriented storage better for analytics (HDFS, Hive)
	- Fact table has hundreds of columns, only need 4-5 of them
	- OLTP uses row/doc/entity as continuous process, very inefficient in OLAP
	- Good for join, since don't need to load all rows only current columns' rows

Column compressins:
	- Bitmap encoding


Sort order
	- Sort by appending order
If sort sort all (since it's column oriented DB)
