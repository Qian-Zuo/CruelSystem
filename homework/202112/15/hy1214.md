## Transaction Processing or Analytics?

**transaction:** a group of reads and writes that form a logic unit.

- **online transaction processing** 
  - records are inserted or updated based on user's input
  - these applications are interactive
- **online analytic processing**
  - queries are often written by business analysts (BI)

### Data Warehousing

*A  data warehouse, by contrast, is a seperate database that analysts can query to their heart's content, without affecting OLTP operations*

**Extract-Transform-Load (ETL):** the process of getting the data into the warehouse

- Data is **extracted** from OLTP databases
- **transformed** into an analysis-friendly schema
- cleaned up, and then **loaded** into the data warehouse

### Stars and Snowflakes: Schemas for Analytics

**star schema:** when the tables relationships are visualized, the fact table is in the middle, surrounded by its dimension tables

**fact table** 

- Each row of the fact table represents an event that occured
- Some of the rows in the fact table are attributes
- Other columns in the fact table are foreign key reference to other tables called **dimension tables**

**snowflake schema:** dimensions are futher broken down into subdimensions



## Column-Oriented Storage

*Don't store all of the values from one row together, but store all the values from each column in a seperate file together instead*

colomnar storage can be significantly faster for ad hoc analytical queries, so it is rapidly gaining popularity

### Column Compression

- **Bitmap encoding**

- **Run-length encoding**

*column family* (used in Hbase & Cassandra) store all columns from a row together along with row key, inherited from BigTable, is still row-oriented

### Sort Order in Column Storage

The data needs to be sorted an entire row at a time

Advantages:

- can be used as an index
- can help with compression of columns
  - run-length encoding

### Writing to Column-Oriented Storage

**Problem:** column-oriented storage, column compression and sorting all make read faster, but make write slower

**Solution:**  LSM-trees 

## Aggregation

- **materialized view:** an actual copy of the query result, written to disk
  - make database write is expensive, so not often used in OLTP
  - make more sense in read-heavy data warehouse
- **virtual view:** just a short cut for writting queries

**Data Cube:** a special case of a materialized view which is a grid of aggregates grouped by different dimensions

- pro: certain queries become very fast because they have effectively been precomputed
- con: doesnâ€™t have the same flexibility as querying the raw data. 
  - Most data warehouses therefore try to keep as much raw data as possible, and use aggregates such as data cubes only as a performance boost for certain queries.
