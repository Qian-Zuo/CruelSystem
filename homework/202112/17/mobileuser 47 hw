Sort order
	- Sort by appending order
	- If sort sort all (since it's column oriented DB)
		○ Admin should determine the order serquence
			§ By date if more query againts time
		○ First order column + second order column

Write to column-oriented storage
	- LSM-trees

Aggregation: materialized views
	- In relational data model, it's defined like standard (virtual) view
	- Materialized view is an acutual copy of query result, written to disk
		○ When uderlying db changes, a materizled view need to be updated.
	- Virtual view is a shorcut for writing queries.

Summary:
OLTP:
	- User-facing
	- Huge request, less data per request
	- Two main storage strategies
		○ Log-structed
			§ Appending only, delete outdated data
				□ Bitcask, SSTables, LSM-Trees, LevelDB, cassndra, Hbase. Lucene
		○ Update in place school
			§ B tree
				□ Relational DB
				□ No relational DB
OLAP
Less query but huge throughput
