## Summary

On a high level, storage engines fall into two main categories:

- **OLTP:** are optimized for transaction processing
  - user-facing
  - high volumn of queries, each query is small
  - disk seek time is often the bottleneck
- **OLAP:** are optimized for analytics
  - primarily for business analysts, not for end users
  - low volumn of queries, but each query is big
  - disk bandwitdh is often the bottleneck

On the **OLTP** side, there are two storage engine schools

- log-structured school
  - only appending to files and delete obsolete files are permitted
  - Bitcask, SSTables, LSM-trees, LevelDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Lucen, etc.
  - key idea: turn ramdom-access writes to sequential writes on disk
- update-in-place school
  - treat disks as fixed-size pages which can be overwritten
  - B-trees, which are used in all major relational databases

On the **OLAP** side, workloads are so different from OLTP

key idea of **data warehouse:** when your queries require sequentially scan‚Äê ning across a large number of rows, indexes are much less relevant. Instead it becomes important to encode data very compactly, to minimize the amount of data that the query needs to read from disk
