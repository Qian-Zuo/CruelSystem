	secondary indexes

	clustered index (storing row data within index) || nonclustered index(only references to the data)
	compromise: covering index or index with included columns

	multi-column indexes: concatenated index 
						  multi-dimensional index (R-tree)

	 in-memory databases: can be faster because they can avoid the overheads of encoding in-memory data structures in a form that can be written to disk
