star schema (dimensional modeling):
	facts: individual events (attributes + foreign key references(dimension tables))
	simpler for analysts to work with

snowflake schema: dimensions are further broken down into subdimensions;
					more normalized


column-oriented storage:
	each column file containing the rows in the same order

	column comression:
		bitmap encoding: n distinct values -> n separate bitmaps; one bitmap for each distinct value
												one bit for each row
						run-length encoded

		benefits: memory bandwidth and vectorized processing

	sort order:
		benefits: can help with compression of columns
		store the same data sorted in several different ways

	write:
		read fast, write is difficult
