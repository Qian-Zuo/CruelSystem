Relational database vs Document database

	- Document database is schema flexible and beetter performance due to locality(no need to join)
	- Relational database is good at joins, n to n and n t one relationships

Which to use:
If your application has a document like structure, then -> document model
If need to join, probably -> relational database

Document model
Schema on read: similar to dynamic type checking in programming languages


Relational model
Schema on write: similar to static type checking in programing language

Data locality:
Reasonable locality could improve the performance. 

Convergence of document and relational databases

PostgreSQL, MySQL, DB2 supports json

Documents database: RethinkDB supports joins
