Document databases: one-to-many: same as hierarchical model
                    many-to-one and many-to-many: unique identifier (foreign key, document reference)



relational databases: better support for joins, and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.

document data model:  schema flexibility, bet‚Äê ter performance due to locality

			document-like structure
