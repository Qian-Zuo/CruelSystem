# SSTables and LSM-Trees

**Sorted String Table**: require key-value pairs sorted by key

Advantages over log segments with hash:

- Merging segments is simple and efficient

- One key for every few kBs is sufficient

- group records into blocks and compress before writing to disks

  - saving disk space
  - reduce I/O bandwidth use

### Constructing and maintaining SSTables

work scheme of storage engine:

- when writing, add it to a in-memory tree called **memtable**

- when memtable gets bigger (a few MBs), write it to disk as a SSTable file

- when reading, first find in the cache (memtable), then the most recent in the disk, and then the next-order, etc

- merge and compact in the background when needed.

**the only problem:** if the database crashes, writes in the memory (memtable) are lost
**solution:** keep a seperate log on disk which is sequentially appended (*WAL*, Write-ahead logging)

The algorithm above is used by **LevelDB** and **RocksDB**

SSTable and memtable were introduced by Google's Bigtable paper, which also inspired Cassandra and HBase which use similar storage engine.

### Making an LSM-tree out of SSTables

originally this indexing structure is from **Log-Strutured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree)**

storage engines that are based on this principle of merging and compacting sorted files are often called **LSM storage engines** 

**Lucene** uses a similar method for storing its *term dictionary* for full-text search

### Performence optimizations

**Problem:** when a key doesn't exist, you have to check all the way back

**Solution:** *Bloom filters*, which is a memory efficient data structure for approxmating the contents of a set

Strategies to compact:

- size-tierd compaction
  
  - used by Hbase and Cassandra

  - newer and smaller SSTables are successively merged into older and larger SSTables

- leveled compaction

  - used by LevelDB and RocksDB and Cassandra

  - compaction proceed more incrementally and use less disk space


**Basic idea of LSM-Tree:** keeping a cascade of SSTables that are merged in the background

- *efficiently perform range queries* since data is stored in sorted order

- *support remarkably high write throughput* since the disk writes are sequential.
