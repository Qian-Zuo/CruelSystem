# Differential Synchronization

**Goal:** Keeping documents synchronized (when collaborating with others or with oneself)

**Main attributes:** symmetrical, state-based, asynchronous, latency tolerent, convergent, flexible, scalable

#### Alternatives:

- **Pessimistic** 

  - hard to collaborate, ill-suited

- **Edit-based** 

  - e.g. Operation Transformation (currently used by Google docs)
  - Chanllenge: all user actions must be captured
  - not naturally convergent

- **Three-way merges**

  - half-duplex
  - don't scale well

  

#### DS Overview

*DS is a symmetrical algorithm employing an unending cycle of background difference (diff) and patch operations*

**Goal:** to keep client text and server text as close as possible with each other at all times

**Enabling feature:** patches may be applied even if the document has changed
