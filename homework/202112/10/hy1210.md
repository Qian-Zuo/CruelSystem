# Scaling LinkedIn

## Early Years

### Leo

single monolithic application

### Member Graph

to manage **member to member connections**, LinkedIn's first service call **Cloud** was born

to keep it seperate from Leo, they used Java **RPC** for communication

### Replica read DBs

to scale profile database, **replica slave DBs** were introduced

replica DBs were a copy of the member database, staying in sync using **databus**

as more and more traffic came, Leo often down, so it's time to kill it and break it up into many small functional and stateless services
