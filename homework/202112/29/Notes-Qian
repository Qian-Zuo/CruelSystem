1. Common Problems with Replication Lag(落后)
   - Single node model - Asyncronously- more read less write: create many followers and distribute the read requests across those followers. 
   This will removes load from the leader and read from nearby replicas.
   - The applications let the user wait to see what they submitted. 
   - A good approach to solve this issue: monotonic reads is a guarantee that this kind of anomaly does not happen.
   
2. Solutions for Replication Lag
   - Read-after-write. Pretending that replication is synchronous when in fact it is asynchronous. This is for single leader.

3. Multi-Leader: each node that processes a write must forward that data change to all the other nodes. In this setup, each leader 
simultaneously acts as a follower to the other leaders.
