1. Synchronous VS Asynchronous Replication
The leader database notifies every foller in real time or not. Sometimes, one part of followers are synchronous, the rest are asynchronous.
The pure synchronous model may waste time because some replicas may can't respond in time due to network fault, crash, etc.

2. Set up new followers
1) take a consistant snapshot of the leader's database, backups are usually needed.
2) copy the snapshot to the new follower node.
3) the follower execute the data change.
4) Make sure the follower has caught up.

3. Handle node outages
The follwer can recover from the log. By connecting to the leader, requesting all the data changes that occurred during the outage.

4. Leader failure: 
1) the leader is not alive when it doesn't respond for a period of time.
2) promote one follower to the new leader. 
3) the other follower are reconfigured to follow the new leader.
Note: a mechanism should be designed to shut down one node if two leaders are detected.
