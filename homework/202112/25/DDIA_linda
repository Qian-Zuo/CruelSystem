Distributed Data:
	scalability:

	Fault tolerance:

	Latency: 

	shared-memory architecture:
		CPU, RAM, disks joined together for one OS -> single machine
	shared-disk architeture: 
		several machines, independent CPU, RAM, but array of disks to share
	shared-nothing:
		Each node uses its CPUs, RAM, and disks independently. 
		coodination between nodes is done at software level-> conventional network

	Replication

	Partitioning == sharding
