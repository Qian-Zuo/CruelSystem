1. Distributed Data to support a distributed system. Properties of distributed data:
  - Scalability - spread the loaded data across multiple machines.
  - Fault tolerance: even if some machines are down, the others can take over.
  - Latency: to avoid too long waiting, there are usually several machines distributed in different geographical locations.
  
2. Distributed shared-nothing architecture : each machine ore virtual machine running the database software is called a node. This is widely used in industry.

3. Replication is used to keep data in different locations.
