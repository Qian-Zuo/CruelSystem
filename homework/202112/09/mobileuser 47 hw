Triple-Stores and SPARQL

Triple-store model is mostly the equivalent to the property graph model, but using different words to describe the same ideas.
Format: three-part statement: (subject, predicate, object) eg (Jim, likes, Bananas)
	- Subject is same to vertex in graph model
	- Object is one of two things:
		○ Properties eg, (lucy, age, 33) -> predicate(谓词） age is like property 
		○ Another vertex in graph, (lucy, married to, allen),  predicate is like a edge
	
	
 The SPARQL query language
Select ?personName where {
Person :name  ?personName
?person :BornIN  // :within*// :name "US".
?person :livesIN  //:within*// :name :Europe"
}


Graph database vs network model

	- Network model: it has schema restriction while graph database doesn't
	- Network model: the only way to access a particular record is to traverse one of the access path. 
		○ In graph datamodel, it can access vertex by its unique ID.
	- In network model, the children of a record are ordered set.
		○ In graph model, vertices and edges are not sorted
	- In network model, all queries are imperative.
		○ In both imperative code and declarative language work.


Summary:

Document database: use case where data comes in self-contained documents and relationships between on documents and another are rare
Graph database goes in the opposite direction, anything is related to everything.
