# Storage and Retrieval

**CRUX:** how we can store the data that we're given, and how we can find it again when we're asked for it

**Storage engine:**

- log-structured
  - many databases internally use a log, which is an append-only data file
- page-oriented
  - B trees

### Data Structures That Power Databases

**Index**: keep some additional metadata on the side to help locate the data you want

**trade-off:** faster read but slower write

#### Hash indexs

*Use them to index data on disk!*

**Bitcask:** well suited to situations where the value for each key is updated frequently

**Compaction**

**Issues of implementation:**

- File format
- Deleting records
- Crash recovery
- Partially written records
- Concurrency control

**Advantages of append-only:**

- operations are sequential, meaning faster
- concurrency and crash recovery is much simpler because of append-only
- merging old segments (compaction) avoids data getting fragmented

**limitations of hashtable:**

- must fit in memory
- range queries are inefficient
