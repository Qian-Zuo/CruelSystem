# Other Indexing Structures

- **primary key:** uniquely identifies one stuff
- **secondary indexes:** might be many rows with the same key
  - by making each value in the index a list of matching row identifier
  - by making each key unique by appending a row identifier to it 

### Storing values with the index

**heap file** avoids duplicate data when multiple secondary indexes are present

- **clustered index:** store the indexed row directly within an index
  - InnoDB in MySQL
- **unclustered index:** store only the references to the data within the index
- **covering index:** store some of a table's columns within the index
  - compromise between clustered and unclustered
