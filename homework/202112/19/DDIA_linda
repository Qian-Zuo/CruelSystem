Encoding Data:
	The trans‐ lation from the in-memory representation to a byte sequence is called encoding
	built-in support for encoding in-memory objects into byte sequences.
	tied to a particular programming language.

	JSON:
		 a lot of ambiguity around the encoding of numbers. 
		 JSON and XML have good support for Unicode character strings (i.e., human- readable text), but they don’t support binary strings

	Binary encoding:
		JSON is less verbose than XML
		include all object field names somewhere else

		Apache Thrift -> binary encoding libraries
			require a schema for any data encoded:
				1. describe the schema in IDL
				2. code generation tool : shema defination -> produce classes

				BinaryProtocol (no field names) and CompactProtocol (packing the field type and tag number into a single byte,)

				dedicated list datatype


		Protocol Buffers ->each field was marked either required or optional

				If a field value is not set, it is simply omitted from the encoded record
				simply ignore that field

				does not have a list or array datatype

		Avro:
			uses a schema
			nothing to identify fields ro their datatypes
			decode: translate from write's schema into reader's schema
