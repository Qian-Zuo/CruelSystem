# Encoding and Evolution

*server-side* employs **rolling grade**, there's many versions of code running at the same time, so you need to ensure that 

- **Backward Compatibility:** newer code can read older data
- **After Compatibility:** older code can read newer data



## Formats for Encoding Data

- In **memory**, data are kept as data sturctures
- In **file** or **network**, data are encoded as stream of bytes

So we need some procedures to translate data between memory and out of memory

- **Encoding (Serialization):** is the translation from in-memory to byte sequence
- **Decoding (Deserializaton):** is the reverse

### Language-Specific Formats

e.g. **pickle** in python

```python
import pickle
pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=None, *, fix_imports=True, buffer_callback=None)
pickle.dumps(obj, protocol=None, *, fix_imports=True, buffer_callback=None)
pickle.load(file, *, fix_imports=True, encoding="ASCII", errors="strict", buffers=None)
pickle.loads(bytes_object, *, fix_imports=True, encoding="ASCII", errors="strict", buffers=None)
```

generally it's not a good idea to use it

**Advantages:**

- convenient

**Disadvantags:**

- language specific, so there's no portability
- security problem. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will **execute arbitrary code during unpickling**
- compatibility and efficiency



### Json, XML, and Binary Variants

problems of JSON, XML and CSV

- ambiguity and precision problem when encoding numbers
- don't support binary strings
- schema problem, you need to explicitly encode fieldname when encoding

##### Binary encoding

when used internally within an org, you can choose a format that is more efficient

*Replace readability with efficiency*

e.g. **MessagePack** for JSON encoding

### Thrift and Protocal Buffers

in thrift and protocal buffers you need a schema definition like:

```c++
// in thrift
struct Person {
	1: required string       username
  2: optional i64          favoriteNumber,
  3: optional list<string> interests
}
```



```c++
// and in protocal buffers
message Person {
  required stirng user_name      = 1;
  optional int64 favorite_number = 2;
  repeated string interests      = 3;
}
```

they each combines with a code generator that generate code from the schema they define in various languages to encode and decode records of the schema

##### Field tags and schema evolution

field tags are critical in schema evolution, especially in terms of compatibility
