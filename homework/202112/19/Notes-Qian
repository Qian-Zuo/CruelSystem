ACID of DB
Atomicity describes what happens if a clent wants to make several writes, but a fault occurs after some of the writes have been processed.
Consistency: includes replica consistency and eventual consistency. 
  - Consistent hashing: is a way of evenly distributing load across an internet-wide system of caches such as a content dilivery network. It uses
    randomly chosen partition boundaries to avoid the need for central control or distributed consensus. This is not a good approach to assign tasks.
 Isolation: several clients access the same database records, it may run into concurrency problem.
 Durability: The purpose of a databse system is to provide a safe place where data can be stored without fear of losing it. Durability is the promise that 
 once a transaction has committed successfully, any data it has written will not be forgotten, even if there is a hardware fault or the database crashes.
