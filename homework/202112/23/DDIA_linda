Modes of Dataflow: (who encodes, who decodes):

	Dataflow through DB:
		writes encodes, reads decodes
		data outlives code
		add default value to old data

		dump to DW: latest schema, immutable, use avro



	service: REST and RPC:
		serviceï¼š The API exposed by the server
		server: a server can itself be a client to another service
		microservies: one service makes a request to another
		services expose an application-specific API that only allows inputs and outputs that are predetermined by the business logic

		key design goal: make services independent


		web service (making API requests over a network):

			REST: a design philosophy, HTTP based;
				less code generation

				more for public API: 

				use a version number in the URL/ HTTP accept header




			SOAP: XML-based, WSDL (API of SOAP) enables code generation;
				client can use loal classes and method calls --> useful in statically typed programming languages;

				rely on tool support, code generation, 

			 good for experimentation and debugging

			 



		

		RPC: make a request to a remove network service == calling a local dunction (location transparency)
				however: local function is predictable; network request may timeout; retry will cause duplication; latency; 

				RPC built on top of encodings

				RPC with binary encoding format can achieve better performance

				for within the same datacenter

				backword/forward compatibilty properties of RPS inherited from encoding: 
				backward compatibilty on requests; forward compatibility on responses;



	Message-Passing Dataflow:
		low latency;
		message sent via message broker: message queue or message-oriented middleware;

		message broker:	
			act as a buffer;
			redeliver message to a crashed process;

			decouples the sender from recipient

			message-passing is one-way (asynchronous)

		1. one process sends a message to a named queue
		2. broker ensures that the message is delivered to consumers/ subscribers
		3. consumer itself publish to another topic/ reply (preserve unknown fields)

		any encoding format
