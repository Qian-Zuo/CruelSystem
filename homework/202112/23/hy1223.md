### RPCs

RPC trys to make a request to a remote machine like calling a function locally (location transparency)

**limitations**

- network request is unpredictabe
- problem of *timeout*
- problem of *idempotence*
- problem of *latency*
- problem of larger objects
- problem of multiple languages
- hard to debug and experiment

REST seems to be deminent for public APIs, whereas RPCs are mainly used between services in the same org, especially within the same datacenter

### Message-Passing Dataflow

somewhere between database and RPC

It's usually oneway, and the sender doesn't wait so it's **asynchronous**

**Advantages** over RPC

- reliable
- useful in a cloud deployment 
- logically decouple the sender and reciever

**Message Queue:** one end sends a message to a *topic*, the message queue ensures that the message is delivered to one or more *subscribers* to this topic

a message is just some bytes with some metadata
