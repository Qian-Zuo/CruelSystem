		Avro:
			uses a schema
			nothing to identify fields ro their datatypes
			decode: translate from write's schema into reader's schema
					in writer, not in reader: ignored
					not in writer, in reader: default value declared in reader

			add/remove field with a default value

			forward compatibility: writer has new version
			backward compatibility: writer has old version

			explicitly mention null can be default

		    writer's schema known by:
		    	large file with lots of records:
		    		include at the begining 

		    	individual records:
					include a version number, keep a list of schema versions

				sending records over a network connection:
					negotiate the schema version on connection setup

			Avro is friendlier to dynamically generated schemas
			Thrift and Protocol Buffers rely on code generation


Modes of Dataflow: (who encodes, who decodes):

	Dataflow through DB:
		writes encodes, reads decodes
		data outlives code
		add default value to old data

		dump to DW: latest schema, immutable, use avro
