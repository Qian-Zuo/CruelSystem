1. JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers, Thrift, and Avro data format are widely used in communication.
   Protocol buffers, Thrift, and Avro all use a schema to describe a binary ending format which are much simpler than XML Schema or JSON Schema,
   which support much more detailed validation rules. And they save some storage space.

2. Thrift and Protocol Buffers rely on code generation: after a schema has been defined, you can generate code that implements this schema in a
programming language of your choice. 

JSON, XML, and CSV have a few nice properties:
1) They are more compact than "binary JSON" by omitting the field name.
2) The schema is a valuable form of documentation, and it is always up to date because the schema is required for decoding.
3) Forward and backward compatibility ofschema changes are needed before deploying.
4) It can generate cde from the schema directly.
