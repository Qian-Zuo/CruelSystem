Schema compatibility
	- Field name change OK
	- Field tag number change not OK
	- Add new field OK
	- New field must be optional
	- Remove optional OK
	- Remove mandatory not OK
	- Data type change, Probably OK but risky
		○ Int -> long OK
		○ Int to String most of time not OK


Avro. Writer/reader schema


For transiting data between different database
Field name is important, no field tag

Writer and reader both have schema


	- Large file with lots of records
		○ Storing a large file containing millions of records, all encoded in same schema
		○ Writer of that file can just include the writer's schema once at the beginning of the file.
	- Send records over network connects
		○ Two process communicate over network connection. They can negotiate the schema version and setup.
	- Dynamic generate schema


Dataflow

Wrong way:
	- Via database
		○ A value in the database may be written by a newer version of the code, and might be read by an older version code. The meaning are deferent.
		○ It could mass up
		○ There might be some special logic in API but if you directly communicate with database is terrible.
Via API (service call)

Via message queue
