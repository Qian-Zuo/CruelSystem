 Graph-like Data Models: mostly many-to-many relationships 

					Property Graphs -> Cypher Query Language

					Triple-Stores -> (subject, predicate, object) (nothing to do with sematic web)

					RDF can be written in XML format; Turtle/N3; Apache Jena can convert between RDF formats. 
					RDF is designed for internet-wide data exchange
					SPARQL is a query language for trple-stores using the RDF data model.

1. Document databases target use cases where data comes in self-contained docu‚Äêments and relationships between one document and another are rare.

2. Graph databases go in the opposite direction, targeting use cases where anything is potentially related to everything
