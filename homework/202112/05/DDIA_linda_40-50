relational databases: better support for joins, and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.
					schema-on-write
					grouping related data together for locality (multi-table index cluster tbles)
					better than imperative code


document data model:schema flexibility, better performance due to locality
					cannot refer directly to a nested item within document
					poor support to joins, poor support to many-to-many relationships
					no enforced schema schema-on-read (the structure is implicit, and only interpreted when the data is read)
					easier to change the format of data

                    use when a document-like structure
                    locality advantage applies if need large parts of documents at the same time
                    On updates to a document, the entire document usually needs to be rewritten—only modifications that don’t change the encoded size of a document can easily be per‐ formed in place
