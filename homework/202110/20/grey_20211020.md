# # Alex Xu: CH 7 DESIGN A UNIQUE ID GENERATOR IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS

## Problem statement
- Characters:
	- unique and sortable
- length
	- 64-bit
- system scale
	- 10k IDs / sec

## High-Level Design
Multi-master replication
- design: Instead of increasing the next ID by 1, we increase it by k, where k is the number of database servers in use.
- drawbacks:
	- hard to scale with multiple data centers
	- IDs do not go up with time across multiple servers.  
	- It does not scale well when a server is added or removed.

UUID
- pros:
	- no coordination between servers
	- easy to scale
- cons:
	- IDs are 128 bits
	- IDs do not go up with time.
	- IDs could be non-numeric.

Ticket Serverdesign
	- design: centralized server
	- pros:
		- IDs are numeric
		- easy to implement
	- cons:
		- single point of failure

Twitter Snowflake
	- design:
		- Sign bit: 1 bit. It will always be 0. This is reserved for future uses.
		- Timestamp: 41 bits. Milliseconds since the epoch or custom epoch.
		- Datacenter ID: 5 bits
		- Machine ID: 5 bits
		- Sequence number: 12 bits. For every ID generated on that machine/process, the sequence number is incremented by 1. The number is reset to 0 every millisecond.
	- properties:
		- the ID generator will work for 69 years
		- 
	- pros:
		- IDs are numeric
		- easy to implement
	- cons:
		- single point of failure
